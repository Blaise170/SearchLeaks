# SearchLeaks

This basic file was created to easily and quickly search a text file line-by-line in order to find matches.
This works particularly well for large text files that can be so massive that normal text editors cannot open them,
much less search them. I became interested in writing this software when I found that several of my online accounts had
been compromised through both Exploit.In and also in the Anti Public leaks.
Due to the sensitivity of the leaks, the files are not included with this software. They are easily found on the internet
however and you can download and search them for yourself. I am not responsible for any misuse of this software and I
provide absolutely no warranty, express or implied, for its use. By using this program, you agree to indemnify, to the
extent permitted by law, any authors or editors of this software.
